## Quick Start

```bash
npm install haip-sdk
```

```typescript
import { createHAIPClient } from 'haip-sdk';

const client = createHAIPClient({
  url: 'ws://localhost:8080',
  token: 'your-jwt-token',
  transport: 'websocket'
});

await client.connect();
const runId = await client.startRun('thread-123');
await client.sendTextMessage('USER', 'Hello, world!', 'user', runId);
```

## Architecture

The SDK is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and provides flexibility:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Client Layer">
    High-level client interface that manages connection lifecycle, handshakes, and protocol state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transport Layer">
    Pluggable transport implementations for different communication protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Layer">
    Core protocol implementation with message validation, flow control, and event handling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Utility Layer">
    Helper functions for message creation, validation, and common operations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Environments

- **Node.js**: Full support with WebSocket and HTTP Streaming transports
- **Browser**: Full support with WebSocket, SSE, and HTTP Streaming transports
- **TypeScript**: Complete type definitions and IntelliSense support
- **JavaScript**: Full compatibility with ES6+ features

## Transport Options

| Transport | Node.js | Browser | Features |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| WebSocket | ✅ | ✅ | Real-time, bidirectional, binary support |
| SSE | ❌ | ✅ | Server-sent events, HTTP POST for sending |
| HTTP Streaming | ✅ | ✅ | Fetch-based streaming, universal compatibility |

## Protocol Support

The SDK implements the complete HAIP v1.1.2 specification:

### Event Types
- **Connection**: HAI (handshake), PING/PONG (heartbeat)
- **Run Lifecycle**: RUN_STARTED, RUN_FINISHED, RUN_CANCEL, RUN_ERROR
- **Messaging**: TEXT_MESSAGE_START, TEXT_MESSAGE_PART, TEXT_MESSAGE_END
- **Audio**: AUDIO_CHUNK for streaming audio data
- **Tools**: TOOL_CALL, TOOL_UPDATE, TOOL_DONE, TOOL_CANCEL, TOOL_LIST, TOOL_SCHEMA
- **Control**: FLOW_UPDATE, PAUSE_CHANNEL, RESUME_CHANNEL, REPLAY_REQUEST
- **Error**: ERROR for protocol and application errors

### Channels
- **USER**: User messages and interactions
- **AGENT**: Agent responses and actions
- **SYSTEM**: Protocol control messages
- **AUDIO_IN**: Incoming audio data
- **AUDIO_OUT**: Outgoing audio data

## Performance Features

- **Flow Control**: Automatic credit-based back-pressure management
- **Reconnection**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry limits
- **Heartbeat**: Configurable ping/pong for connection health monitoring
- **Metrics**: Real-time performance metrics and connection statistics
- **Replay**: Message replay support with cumulative acknowledgments
